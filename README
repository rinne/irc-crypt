Irchat currently supports IDEA-encryption.  To make this possible
also in some (less sophisticated) other clients, we provide this
irc_crypt library.  With this, you should be able to integrate
encryption support to your client if your client (or you) is
totally braindamaged.

This library is provided on `as is' basis and no support for
integration is available.  Bugreports are of course appreciated.
